# HOW TO ADD A LEVEL

1. Create a new branch
2. Create a folder inside of the "Super Bith The Legacy Of Leps" folder
3. Place any assets you make inside of the level folder
4. Merge the branch into main
5. Place the level on the world map, try your best not to cause any merge conflicts (although it should maybe be fine?)
