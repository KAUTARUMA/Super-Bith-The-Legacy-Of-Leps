# HOW TO ADD A LEVEL

1. Create a new branch
2. Create a level in the editor with the "Create Custom Folder" option checked
3. After finishing your level, merge the branch into main
4. Place the level on the world map, try your best not to cause any merge conflicts (although it should maybe be fine?)
